### Bazel ###
# gitignore template for Bazel build system
# website: https://bazel.build/

# Ignore all bazel-* symlinks. There is no full list since this can change
# based on the name of the directory bazel is cloned into.
/bazel-*

# Directories for the Bazel IntelliJ plugin containing the generated
# IntelliJ project files and plugin configuration. Seperate directories are
# for the IntelliJ, Android Studio and CLion versions of the plugin.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
