# Proposal: Pick-a-Flick

Our Proposal is a web-based application that randomly pulls a movie from a range of IMDb's entire database.  With a UI resembling Tinder, the users can pick through random movies with the click of a button.  If the user decides upon a movie, they will be shown a list of locations from which to stream it.  Our goal is to be able to integrate the IMDb-API with a web server and implement a seemless UI.
