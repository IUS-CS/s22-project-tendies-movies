# Pick-a-Flick

Pick-a-Flick is a web-based app aiding the user in choosing a what movie to watch based on IMDb rankings.  This application eases the indecision of having to pick what movie to watch by either by picking a random movie from IMDB's top 250, or by finding a movie based on genre of the top 50 movies within 19 different genres. The website will continue to cycle through movies based on the selected genre until the user finds a movie they would enjoy watching. The website also allows a user to start over, should they decide the movie chosen is not the one they would like to enjoy. The website follows popular dating apps in a simple yes or no selection after the user chooses a genre or to randomize completely until the user finds the movie they would enjoy.
