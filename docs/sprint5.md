Date: 2022-04-19

Members present:

* Tyler Schickel
* Eli Nutter
  
## Demo

This sprint, we completed:

* Optimization
  -Website is much, much faster now
* UI Cleanup
  -Everything is much easier to read, the genres have been cleaned up, and there is a page for each genre now

## Retrospective

* There was a lot to be done on the website. The website was slow, but now the website is much faster. A button click doesn't take a couple minutes to load, and is now down to mere seconds. The UI is also much cleaner. Color changes to the fonts, images for each genre, and so on make the website much more pleasant to look at. For two people finishing out the website, the project has really come together.

### Good

* Website is much faster
* Website is much nicer to look at
* Code is much cleaner

### Bad

* Communication was a little spotty
* Down to the minute coding(resulted in a good product, but almost out of the time constraint for the sprint)

### Actionable Commitments

* Continuing improving UI
* Look into CSS implementation 
* Improve unit test-new website means new unit tests

## Planning

The goal now is to finish cleaning up documentation and prepare for the presentation.
