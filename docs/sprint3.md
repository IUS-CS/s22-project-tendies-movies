## Retrospective

* The group continues to make progress. The website feels much better with the implementation of the movie class. The home page gives a bit more room to grow the website with genre choice being implemented. The movie class helps a ton as well. Everyone continues to seem optimistc and putting the time into the research and development of this website. 

### Good

* New, interesting features added
* Code was really cleaned up
* Website feels like it has much more room to grow
* Group continues to feel optimistic for this project

### Bad

* Work flow felt slightly unsteady at times. Progress was made, but did not feel consistent. 
* Nearly missed all deliverables needed for this sprint.
* Difficulty adding unit tests

### Actionable Commitments

* Continue to implement ideas for the website
* Continue to increase readabilty of the website
* Add more customization to make website really pop
* Complete a couple unit tests for the program

## Planning

Next step is customization and taking a look at unit testing. Unit testing seems to be a bit of a barrier to us, but we're making strides in having the website become more testable.
