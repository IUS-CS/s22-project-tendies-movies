This project has become a sort of passion project of mine. At first, the tools seemed new and overwhelming. Developing a front page seemed like a huge task, but as I spent more time researching and developing the project, it became more interesting, and I wanted to see how much further we could develop the project. My first was developing a beta page. It had a simple image and some buttons that went no where. Then came the task of develop a page for the user to access after a simple button press. Next was implementing the Cinemagoer tool. I was able to get basic information access and displayed on the webpages we were building, but after some group help, we were able to get everything we needed shown. Next we had to access all the different elements of the list generated by Cinemagoer and display them on the webpages. I then spent time updating our UI and code to be able to find movie by genres. This part took a few dozen hours to find all the different genres, implement a new button for each genre, and then testing each button to ensure the correct information was displayed. Unit testing was a blockage for our group for some time, but I was able to develop a set of tests that was able to prove that the method I produced correctly finds movies by genre. The downside was the unit tests proved that our code was currently slow. Cinemagoer accesses a lot of information at once, and this has become an obstacle in optimization of our code. The final goal was to customize our UI so it was easier to read and add a little flair.

Overall, the final product feels far from finished. We had hoped to add CSS to our project to smooth out the rough edges, but time and manpower became a constraint. I plan to fork this project and work on it on my spare time to keep expanding on my knowledge of python, flask, HTML, and CSS. The goal would be to cycle through the top 50 of each genre of movie, and one day cycle through any movie in the IMDB database. Finally, it was originally planned to display where to currently stream each movie, but that has become a project for the future. The product works, and it works well with what we have. It's just a start for what could one day be a much larger product.
