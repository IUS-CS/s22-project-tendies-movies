## Retrospective

* Group improved in overall communication since last sprint. Discord has been more active, and group members have taken on more responsibility. We discovered some limitations in our skill set and build environment we're working with, but group members are working to improve those limitations and learn the tools we are currently working with.

### Good

* Communication improved
* Close to a working prototype with basic functions
* Developed three working web pages

### Bad

* 

### Actionable Commitments

* Develop more ideas on how to improve website
* Organize code into a more optimal format

## Planning

We plan to start expanding on the UI, adding more functionality such as being able to choose movies by genre. We also plan to improve readability of the website and expand upon information presented to users.
