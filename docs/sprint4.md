# Sprint 4 Ceremony Minutes
  
Date: 2022-04-05

Members present:

* Tyler Schickel
* Eli Nutter
  
## Demo

This sprint, we completed:

* Basic unit testing
    * There is now a module that does basic data verification based on the inputs in the MovieClass
* Code refactoring
    * Cleaned up MovieClass and added optimizations
    * Made the main function easier to read and understand

## Retrospective

* We may not have been able to push all of the features we were hoping implement. Testing turned out to be a difficult concept to implement in practice. Additionally, we lost a team member during this sprint. This made progress relatively slow.

### Good

* Testing has been implemented
* Communication was good and prompt
* Minor optimizations to the code have been made

### Bad

* Lost a team member
* Website performance is slow

### Actionable Commitments

* Optimize website performance
* Finalize code base refactor
* Clean up UI and readability

## Planning

Optimization is the big thing. The website runs very slowly at the moment. The Cinemagoer module is pulling lots of data and needs to be adjusted. Additionally, some final work on the UI to make it a little more user friendly is in order. There are also some last touch-ups to be made for the code's readability as well.
