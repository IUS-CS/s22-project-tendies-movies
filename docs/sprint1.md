## ---- Retrospective ----


### Good

* Tyler developed a working prototype
* Documentation has been made and ready to be developed alongside the project
* Build environment has been configued, unit testing and all

### Bad

* Communication and teamwork
* Equal dispersion of responsibilities

### Actionable Commitments

* More active communication (discord, voicecalls, etc)

## Planning

The big goal is to get the user interface to function (get the buttons to do something). We'll do this by integrating with IMDb's API to pull movie data from their database. Then, display it on our website.
